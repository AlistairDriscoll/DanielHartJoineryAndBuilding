## Project status

This branch represents the **full-stack version** of the Daniel Hart Joinery & Building website, built using Django.

The project is now being continued as a **frontend-only static site** in a separate branch, with this version retained for reference.

## Deployment

This full-stack Django version of the site was developed and tested locally.

During development, the project was configured for deployment using a production-ready setup, including `gunicorn`, `dj-database-url`, and Cloudinary for media storage. This branch is retained as the final full-stack implementation.

The project is now being continued as a frontend-only static site, which will be deployed using static hosting (e.g. GitHub Pages or similar), simplifying infrastructure and ongoing maintenance.
