                    Hi there, I am a joiner/carpenter from Leeds. I have 30 or so yearsâ€™ experience, mainly in construction, but I have also worked in film and theatre, and as a cabinet maker for several years. Because of this varied work, my strong point is doing one-off bespoke projects that require a little bit of invention and creativity. All aspects of the building trade are covered and other works include, bathrooms, kitchens, extensions and basement conversions.
