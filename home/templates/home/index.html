                Hi, my name is Daniel Hart, and I am a joiner/carpenter based in Leeds with around 30 years of experience in the construction industry. My career has included work in film and theatre, as well as several years as a cabinet maker. This varied background means I specialise in one-off bespoke projects that require creativity and inventive solutions. I cover all aspects of the building trade, including bathrooms, kitchens, extensions, and basement conversions. I have recently moved away from Checkatrade and will now be using my own website—feel free to request a quote using the links provided.
